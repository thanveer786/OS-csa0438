1)Create an array of struct Process to store process information.
2)For each process i from 1 to n:
a. Read the burst time for the process i.
b. Initialize the remainingTime for process i with the burst time.
3)Set currentTime to 0.
4)Initialize remainingProcesses to n.
5)Repeat until all processes are completed (remainingProcesses > 0):
a. For each process i from 0 to n - 1:
i. If processes[i].remainingTime is greater than 0:
Calculate executeTime as the minimum of quantum and processes[i].remainingTime.
Decrement processes[i].remainingTime by executeTime.
Increment currentTime by executeTime.
Display that process i is executing for executeTime units, with its remaining time.
If processes[i].remainingTime becomes 0:
Decrement remainingProcesses by 1.
Display that process i has completed its execution.
6)Display the completion of all processes.
7)End
