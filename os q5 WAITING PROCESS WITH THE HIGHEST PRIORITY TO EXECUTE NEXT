1)Initialize a data structure to store processes and their priorities (e.g., an array or a priority queue).

2)Insert processes into the data structure with their respective priorities.

3)Build the data structure into a max-heap (or equivalent priority structure).

4)Repeat the following steps until there are no more processes in the data structure:

a. Extract the process with the highest priority from the data structure.

b. Execute the extracted process.

c. If there are more processes in the data structure, go back to step 4a.
