1. Include necessary headers (e.g., <stdio.h>).

2. Define a structure to represent a process with the following attributes:
   - Process ID (PID)
   - Arrival Time
   - Burst Time

3. Create an array of processes to represent the set of processes, and initialize their attributes based on the given considerations. For example:
   - All processes are activated at time 0.
   - Assume no process waits on I/O devices.
   - Set the PID, Arrival Time, and Burst Time for each process.

4. Sort the processes in the array based on their arrival times in ascending order.

5. Initialize a variable `current_time` to 0 to keep track of the current time.

6. Initialize a variable `waiting_time` to 0 to calculate the total waiting time for all processes.

7. Loop through the sorted array of processes:
   -
