1)Input the number of processes (num_processes).

2)Declare a structure struct Process with fields: ID, arrival time, execution time (burst time), and priority.

3)Allocate memory for an array of num_processes Process structures.

4)For each process in the array, do the following:

a.Input the arrival time for the process.

b.Input the execution time (burst time) for the process.

c.Set the priority of the process to its execution time.

5)Sort the array of processes based on their arrival times in ascending order. This helps in scheduling processes that arrive earlier first.

6)Initialize current_time to 0 (the current time is the time elapsed so far).

7)Print the Gantt Chart header.

8)For each process in the sorted array of processes, do the following:

a. Print a bar in the Gantt Chart to represent the start of the execution of the current process.

b. Update current_time by adding the execution time of the current process.

c. Print spaces in the Gantt Chart to represent the time interval for the execution of the current process.

d. Repeat steps a-c for the next process in the sorted array.

9)Print a vertical bar to mark the end of the Gantt Chart.

10)Free the allocated memory for the array of processes.

11)End.
